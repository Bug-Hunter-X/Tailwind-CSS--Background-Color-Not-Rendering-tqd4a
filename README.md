# Tailwind CSS Background Color Not Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where background colors fail to render as expected. This is typically due to an incorrectly configured `tailwind.config.js` file. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file includes a simple div with a Tailwind CSS class for a gray background. If `tailwind.config.js` doesn't explicitly include the `gray` color palette, this color won't be rendered correctly.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to correctly configure `tailwind.config.js` to include the gray color palette. This ensures that all Tailwind CSS classes related to gray colors are correctly compiled and rendered.
