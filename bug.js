```javascript
<div class="bg-gray-300 p-4">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style a div element. However, the `bg-gray-300` class might not render the expected background color if the `tailwind.config.js` file isn't configured correctly. Specifically, the `gray` color palette might not be included in the theme configurations.
